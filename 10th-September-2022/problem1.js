/*

Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.

Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.

Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.

Call nb_dig (or nbDig or ...) the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.

Examples:
n = 10, d = 1 
the k*k are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
We are using the digit 1 in: 1, 16, 81, 100. The total count is then 4.

nb_dig(25, 1) returns 11 since
the k*k that contain the digit 1 are:
1, 16, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 361, 441.
So there are 11 digits 1 for the squares of numbers between 0 and 25.
Note that 121 has twice the digit 1.

// P => two integers n and d 
// R => one integer which is the length of the number of numbers that has d
// E => nb_dig(25, 1) returns 11

function nbDig(n, d) {
    // create an empty array
    // start a for loop
    // push all values up to n squared
    // then check if any of the elements d
    // if yes, then create another array of these elements
    // return it
