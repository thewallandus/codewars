/*

In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

// P: two lists => arrays of integers
// R: returns the difference between the volume of both
// E: [2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1] => 20
// P

function findDifference(a, b) {
    // find volume of a
    // find volume of b
    // minus volume b by volume a 
    // But first find the bigger number and the smaller number
    // return the difference
