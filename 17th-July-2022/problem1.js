/*

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

 */

// P: string representing the state of the light
// R: string representing the state of the next light
// E: ("green"), "yellow");
// P: pseudo-code

function updateLight(current) {
  // conditional that checks color
  // returns a string with the new color
    

}
