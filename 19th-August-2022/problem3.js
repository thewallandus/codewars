/*

An AI has infected a text with a character!!

This text is now fully mutated to this character.

If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!

Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.

Example
text before = "abc"
character   = "z"
text after  = "zzz"

*/

// P => string and character to turn it to
// R => if length === 0 then return empty string
// R => else === change all characters with char
// // E => text before = "abc"
// character   = "z"
// text after  = "zzz"
// P

function contamination(text, char){
    // Code here ;)
