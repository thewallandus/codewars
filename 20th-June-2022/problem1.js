/* 

Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000
Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59

*/

// CLOCK shows h hours.
// Clock shows m minutes.
// Clock shows s seconds.
// Create a function.
// This function will take in 3 parameters: hours, minutes, seconds.
// Then it will multiply and convert the parameters into seconds.
// Convert this number/variable into 1000 miliseconds.
// Return.
