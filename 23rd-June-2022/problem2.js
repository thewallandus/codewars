/*

Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

For example:

"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.

// In DNA: there are 4 nucleic acid bases.
// GCAT.
// RNA and DNA is very similar except it translates T into U.
// Create an empty string first.
// So create a loop that loops through the string.
// Then check if the string element is T: if YES, then convert it to U.
// Push it and replace the string in the string sequence and keep carrying on.
// RETURN IT.


function DNAtoRNA(dna) {
    // create a function which returns an RNA sequence from the given DNA sequence
