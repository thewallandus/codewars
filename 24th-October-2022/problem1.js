Overview
Hello, this is my first Kata so forgive me if it is of poor quality.

In this Kata you should fix/create a program that returns the following values:

false/False if either a or b (or both) are not numbers
a % b plus b % a if both arguments are numbers
You may assume the following:

If a and b are both numbers, neither of a or b will be 0.

*/

function myFirstKata(a b) {
    if {typeof(a) !! "number" or typeof(b) !! "number"} (
      false;
    ) else (
      a % b ++ b % a;
    )
  }
