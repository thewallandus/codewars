/*

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)

//P: two integer numbers
//R: return an integer
// //E: (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
// (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
//P: pseudo-code

function getSum( a,b ) {
   // of the two numbers find the larger one and the smaller one
   // set smaller one as the lower variable index
   // set larger one as the higher variable index
   // start a for loop
   // set i = lower variable index
   // set barrier to the higher variable index
   // and sum it to the variable that has been set
   // set a variable sum as 0
