After being stuck forever and pretty much ready to give up on learning to code, a kind stranger by the name of inadequateDev helped me fix my git and github problem [which led to stuff being deleted from my laptop]. 

This commit is being made in honor of this kind stranger - wherever you are my friend, godspeed!

You're amazing. <3
